- I like **Dart** because it's **boring**.
- Might learn some **Rust** some day &ndash; I enjoyed it [once](https://github.com/angel333/](https://github.com/angel333/apache-mod-status-parser)) already.
- Here's a project I'm working on &ndash; [LangLab](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ondrejsimek.langlab) _(it's still alpha)_.
